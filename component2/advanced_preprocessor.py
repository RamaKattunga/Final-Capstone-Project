        # QUALITY CHECKS TO IMPLEMENT:
        # 1. Missing values: Count null/empty values in each column
        # 2. Duplicates: Find exact and near-duplicate entries
        # 3. Category consistency: Check for category variations

        # 5. Data types: Verify expected data types

        # 
        # ASSESSMENT PROCESS:
