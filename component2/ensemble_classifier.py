        # Think of it like having a panel of experts vote on each decision.
        # 
        # BASE MODELS TO CREATE:
        # 1. Logistic Regression: Fast, interpretable linear model
        # 2. Random Forest: Tree-based model good at capturing non-linear patterns
        # 3. SVM: Support Vector Machine for complex decision boundaries
        # 4. Neural Network: Multi-layer perceptron for complex patterns
        # 5. Naive Bayes: Probabilistic model good for text classification
        # 
        # MODEL CONFIGURATION:
        # - Use consistent random_state=42 for reproducibility
        # - Set class_weight='balanced' to handle imbalanced data
        # - Configure appropriate parameters for text classification
